The journal is where you can take all sorts of notes and prepare your handouts. They are not limited to text and can both insert images directly inside the text with the rich text field, plus each entry can also be assigned a main image that can be displayed as a standalone handout, useful for showcasing that awesome artwork of your city! As with actors, scenes and items, you can organize them into folders to keep them organized.

# Linking Entities
One of Foundry's feature allows you to link entities in the various rich text editor in the platform. However, the synthax is often forgotten, so here it is: **`@EntityType[NameOfEntity]`**. There are currently three `Entry Type` supported like such:
* Actors
* Items (Reminder that in Foundry, this applies to many different things, including spells, classes and feats!)
* JournalEntry (no space)

**Any entry you want to link in such way need to be directly into the correct tab of your game, you cannot currently link from a compendium!**
