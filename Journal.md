The journal is where you can take all sorts of notes and prepare your handouts. They are not limited to text and can both insert images directly inside the text with the rich text field, plus each entry can also be assigned a main image that can be displayed as a standalone handout, useful for showcasing that awesome artwork of your city! As with actors, scenes and items, you can organize them into folders to keep them organized.

# Linking Entities
One of Foundry's feature allows you to link entities in the various rich text editor in the platform. However, the synthax is often forgotten, so here it is: **`@EntityType[NameOfEntity]`**. There are currently three `Entry Type` supported like such:
* Actors
* Items (Reminder that in Foundry, this applies to many different things, including spells, classes and feats!)
* JournalEntry (no space)

## Troubleshooting
Any entry you want to link in such way need to be directly into the correct tab of your game, you **cannot currently link from a compendium!** Also, the link won't actually appear as a link in the **edit mode**, you have to save your work to get out of edit mode to be able to click the link. Once out of edit mode, it should display as a link with a little icon to the side of it. If it still appears as `@EntityType[NameOfEntity]`, something else breaks the link. Lastly, be sure that the part between the brackets [] corresponds exactly to the entry you want to link. Some **special characters** in the name of the entry might break the link as well, in which case you'll have to rename the entry you want to link before you do so.
